# Sange

Build, parse and optimize console commands.

## Development

### Parser

Difficult examples:

```shell
foo bar "baz" "wow" --number 123 --text=hello
foo -abc -n10 -vvv
```

## There will be some documentation available, right?

I will try to write some, can't promise.

## Why "Sange"?

Because I really enjoy Dota 2.

## What about license?
